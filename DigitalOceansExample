-- Analyzing Data with Aggregate Functions

SELECT SUM(total_inventory) FROM product_information;

SELECT MAX(product_cost) AS cost_max 
FROM product_information;

SELECT MIN(product_retail) AS retail_min 
FROM product_information;

SELECT AVG(product_retail) AS retail_average, 
AVG(product_cost) AS cost_average 
FROM product_information;

-- Use the COUNT function with the WHERE statement to query the number of products whose retail value is more than $8.00:
SELECT COUNT(product_retail) 
FROM product_information 
WHERE product_retail > 8.00;

-- Now query the number of products from product_cost that were purchased by the store for more than $8.00:
SELECT COUNT(product_cost) 
FROM product_information 
WHERE product_cost > 8.00;
